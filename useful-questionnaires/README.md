# Useful questionnaires

We store here various useful questionnaires.

Currently, there are two types of useful questionnaires:

- validation questionnaires, used when we need to validate a feature in a Bowie piece of software (ex: a new component in Lunatic),
- training questionnaires, used as material for training or self training (ex: the final output of the base Pogues self-training).
